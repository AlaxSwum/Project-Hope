# Hope IMS - Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers deploying the Hope IMS (Inventory Management System) to production with security, performance, and reliability best practices.

## Critical Security Changes Made

### üîí Service Role Key Security Fix
**CRITICAL**: The Supabase service role key has been moved from the frontend to secure API routes:
- ‚ùå **Before**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (exposed to client)
- ‚úÖ **After**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (server-side only)

**Action Required**: Update your environment variables and never expose service role keys to the frontend.

## Environment Variables

### Required Production Variables
```bash
# Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key  # Server-side only!

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-secret-key

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production

# Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn.ingest.sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-sentry-dsn.ingest.sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ORG=your-org
SENTRY_PROJECT=your-project
```

## Deployment Options

### 1. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

#### Build and Run
```bash
# Build production image
cd frontend
docker build -t hope-ims:latest .

# Run with environment variables
docker run -d \
  --name hope-ims \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env.production \
  hope-ims:latest
```

#### Using Docker Compose
```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Development with hot reload
docker-compose --profile dev up -d
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Traditional Hosting

```bash
# Build the application
cd frontend
npm ci --only=production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow includes:

1. **Code Quality**: Linting and type checking
2. **Testing**: Unit tests with coverage reporting
3. **Security**: Dependency scanning with Snyk
4. **E2E Testing**: Playwright browser tests
5. **Build**: Production build verification
6. **Docker**: Multi-platform image building
7. **Deploy**: Automated deployment to staging/production

### Required GitHub Secrets
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
SENTRY_DSN
SNYK_TOKEN
REGISTRY_URL
REGISTRY_USERNAME
REGISTRY_PASSWORD
```

## Performance Optimization

### Implemented Optimizations
- Bundle splitting and tree shaking
- Image optimization with WebP/AVIF
- Gzip compression
- Static generation where possible
- Cache-first loading strategies

### Monitoring
- Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- Performance metrics via Sentry
- Memory and CPU monitoring in Docker

## Security Considerations

### Headers
Security headers are automatically applied:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled in Supabase
- Service role key never exposed to client
- API routes handle privileged operations

### Error Handling
- Sentry captures and reports errors
- Sensitive information filtered from error reports
- Graceful error boundaries in React components

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design
- Health checks for load balancer integration
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Database
- Connection pooling via Supabase
- Query optimization and indexing
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Security Updates**: Monthly dependency updates
2. **Monitoring**: Weekly review of error reports
3. **Performance**: Monthly performance audits
4. **Backups**: Daily database backups (via Supabase)

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check application health
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Expected response
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123456,
  "environment": "production",
  "checks": {
    "database": "ok",
    "memory": { "used": 45, "total": 128 },
    "nodeVersion": "v18.18.0"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check environment variables are set
   - Verify Node.js version compatibility
   - Review build logs for missing dependencies

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase URL and keys
   - Check network connectivity
   - Review RLS policies

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor memory usage via health endpoint
   - Check Sentry performance metrics
   - Review database query performance

### Support
- Error tracking: [Sentry Dashboard]
- Performance monitoring: Built-in metrics
- Logs: Docker logs or platform-specific logging

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. ‚úÖ Application loads correctly
2. ‚úÖ Authentication works
3. ‚úÖ Health endpoint responds
4. ‚úÖ Error tracking operational
5. ‚úÖ Performance monitoring active
6. ‚úÖ Database connectivity confirmed

---

**Next Steps**: After deployment, monitor the application closely for the first 24-48 hours and set up alerts for critical metrics.
