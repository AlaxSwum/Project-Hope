-- Password Manager Schema - Simple Fix for RLS Recursion
-- This completely removes RLS temporarily and uses service-level security

-- Disable RLS on all password manager tables to eliminate recursion
ALTER TABLE password_folders DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE password_entries DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE password_shares DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all for admin users" ON password_folders;

-- Grant basic permissions for authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON password_folders TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON password_entries TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON password_shares TO authenticated;

-- Insert some default folders for testing (safe way)
